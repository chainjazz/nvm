# nvm
Abstract VN computer

An implementation of a specific abstract maschine described in
"Compilation of programming exercises with solutions" (V. Ćirić, 1978. University in Belgrade)

VN stands for "von-Neumann like".

Additional implementation of a (primitive) compiler-assembler-linker pipeline.

Useful for having an abstract target architecture for developing:

* machine code programs
* assemblers, languages, parsers, lexers, linkers
* a small-footprint general purpose virtual computer
* practical validator for exercises in machine code programming
